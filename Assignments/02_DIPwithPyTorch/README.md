### Datasets

To download `facades` dataset, run this command on Linux:

```bash
bash ./download_facades_dataset.sh
```

To download `cityscapes` dataset, run this command on Linux:

```bash
sed -e 's/facades/cityscapes/g' ./download_facades_dataset.sh | bash
```

### Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```bash
python -u train.py > train.log
```

### Pre-Trained Model

A pre-trained model can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/iw16/DIP-Teaching/releases/pix2pix_model_epoch_800.pth). Dataset `cityscapes` is used.
