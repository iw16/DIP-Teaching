# 03_PlayWithGANs

This is an increment of Pix2Pix with cGAN and a combination of DragGAN and face-alignment.

## Requirements

To install requirements on Linux:

```bash
cd path/to/03_PlayWithGANs
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deep Learning-Based Pix2Pix with cGAN

### Datasets

To download `facades` dataset, run this command on Linux:

```bash
bash cgan/download_facades_dataset.sh
```

To download `cityscapes` dataset, run this command on Linux:

```bash
sed -e 's/facades/cityscapes/g' cgan/download_facades_dataset.sh | bash
```

### Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```bash
python -u train.py > train.log
```
